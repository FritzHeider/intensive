<p>Tiny Toronto's goal is to facilitate healthy and environmentally sustainable living standards through attainable housing. We will accomplish this goal by developing small structures in backyards that are legally-permitted, tax-paying, and rent-able, living spaces. Our housing project is designed to support the needs of diverse demographics across the city. Our two other projects (neighborhood food share programs and car docâ€™s for publically rent-able cars) will help to make attainable housing opportunities possible.</p>
