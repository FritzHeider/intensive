<p>TinyHomeMe's goal is to facilitate healthy and environmentally sustainable living standards through attainable housing. We will accomplish this goal by developing small structures in backyards that are legally-permitted, tax-paying, and rent-able, living spaces. Our housing project is designed to support the needs of diverse demographics across the city. Our two other projects (neighborhood food share programs and car docâ€™s for publically rent-able cars) will help to make attainable housing opportunities possible.</p>

<p>The housing crisis in California has caused the limitations of building tiny homes in ones backyards to be removed, as a result almost anyone can legally get permitted to build these low cost structures for thermselves, family, or to function as the source of a second income</p>
<p>Elderly people considering reverse mortgages which esentially takes the property out of the family have another plan to considier, Instead they may finance a tiny home through an income share agreement that would allow their assets to remain theirs</p>
